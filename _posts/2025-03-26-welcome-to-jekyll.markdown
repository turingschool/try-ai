Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we interact with technology and the world around us. From virtual assistants to self-driving cars, AI is at the forefront of innovation, enabling machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

AI encompasses a wide range of fields, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. These technologies work together to analyze data, recognize patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

AI has the potential to revolutionize industries such as healthcare, finance, and education. However, it also raises important ethical questions about privacy, bias, and the future of work.
